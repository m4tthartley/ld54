This is the version of the game submitted to Ludum Dare 54.

There are a few remaining issues, the biggest of which is that the WASAPI api fails to initialise on some systems.
You can still play the game, however, just without any audio.

The version of my core library used for the submission is included in the lib folder.
I continually update the core library, so this ensures this version of the game will always compile.

I rushed this version of the library out for Ludum Dare and cut lots of corners, so please don't use this as a reference for how to do things well.
